                He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO)
                and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and military missile development 
                efforts.He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India for his work on the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
                He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original
                nuclear test by India in 1974.

                While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 27

          Personal Life of A.P.J Abdul Kalam
        </h2>
        <section class="personal">
          <div>
            <h2>A.P.J Abdul Kalam Birth and Early Life</h2>
            <p class="pm">
                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was born on 15 October 1931, to a Sunni Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban
                Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local
                mosque;[9] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram
                and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had
                been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
                coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved trading groceries between
                the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the
                Pamban Bridge to the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by the 1920s, apart from
                the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's
                meager income.

            <h2>A.P.J Abdul Kalam Education</h2>
            <p class="pm">
                In his school years, Kalam had average grades but was described as a bright and hardworking student who had a strong desire to learn. He spent hours
                on his studies, especially mathematics.After completing his education at the Schwartz Higher Secondary School, Ramanathapuram, Kalam went on to attend
                Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli, then affiliated with the University of Madras, from where he graduated in physics in 1954.He moved to
                Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering in Madras Institute of Technology.[13] While Kalam was working on a senior class project, the Dean was
                dissatisfied with his lack of progress and threatened to revoke his scholarship unless the project was finished within the next three days. Kalam met
                the deadline, impressing the Dean, who later said to him, "I was putting you under stress and asking you to meet a difficult deadline."He narrowly
                missed achieving his dream of becoming a fighter pilot, as he placed ninth in qualifiers, and only eight positions were available in the IAF.

            <h2>A.P.J Abdul kalam Death and Later Life</h2>
            <p class="pm">
                On 27 July 2015, Kalam travelled to Shillong to deliver a lecture on "Creating a Livable Planet Earth" at the Indian Institute of Management
                Shillong. While climbing a flight of stairs, he experienced some discomfort, but was able to enter the auditorium after a brief rest.At around
                6:35 p.m. IST, only five minutes into his lecture, he collapsed.[86][87] He was rushed to the nearby Bethany Hospital in a critical condition;
                upon arrival, he lacked a pulse or any other signs of life.[86] Despite being placed in the intensive care unit, Kalam was confirmed dead of a
                sudden cardiac arrest at 7:45 p.m. IST.[86][88][89] His last words, to his aide Srijan Pal Singh, were reportedly: "Funny guy! Are you doing well?"
